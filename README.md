# The Doggo web app

The cutest little web app I made, view doggos on the click of a button. This website uses simplest HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I made this while learning about AJAX and APIs. This uses my favourite API which returns a new doggo image with every response, find it here https://dog.ceo/api/.

Future updates I might work on - 
Adding breed options;
Searching;
Downloading/wallpaper

Open for any suggestion in the issues section.
